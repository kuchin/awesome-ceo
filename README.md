 * 📕 [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://amzn.com/dp/B07WF972WK) - Stephen Covey <br>

It's actually very smart and actionable: principles of personal responsibility, proactive action, and continuous improvement. An approach to achieving success and fulfillment, developing strong personal relationships, cultivating a growth mindset, and aligning your actions with a clear sense of purpose.

   A framework for improving your decision-making abilities. Our automatic, intuitive "fast" thinking often leads to errors and biases, while our more deliberate and analytical "slow" thinking can help us make better decisions and avoid common pitfalls.
 * 📕 [The Mom Test: How to talk to customers & learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you](https://amzn.com/dp/B01H4G2J1U) - Rob Fitzpatrick [![twitter](https://socialize-md.vercel.app/api/badge/twitter)](https://twitter.com/robfitz) <br>
